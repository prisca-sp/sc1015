# Problem 
Identifying patterns and trends in the evolution of video game genres over time to predict emerging genres/shifts in popularity

Using regression models and Natural Language Processing, we aimed to analyse how different factors (ratings, reviews etc.) can contribute to a genre's popularity.
This is useful as it can offer developers or investors of video games insights as to what genre can potentially rise in the future.

# Learning beyond the course
- Utilisation of visualisation tools such as wordclouds, bar-line charts, pie charts etc.
- Natural Language Processing, TextBlob, TFIDF
- Cleaning of language
- Logistic regression, clustering models
