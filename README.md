# 1. Motivation behind Problem Statement
As of current, there are video games being released everyday, catered to different kinds of audiences. In 2023, more than 12000 games have been released. That is 32 games being released each day. In 2024, there has been 2403 games released and more are in the making. With such high numbers, there is furious competition between companies and indie game creators when releasing their game and ensuring that their games succeeds in the gaming scene. In order to keep up with the trend and ensuring that the games they create make a big hit to the scene, we have decided to look into the trend of games that are popular within the community currently to allow game creators and companies to have a better gauge on what type of games the community is looking for and what might be more attractive right now.

# 2. Problem Statemment
Identifying patterns and trends in the evolution of video game genres over time to predict emerging genres/shifts in popularity

Using regression models and Natural Language Processing, we aimed to analyse how different factors (ratings, reviews etc.) can contribute to a genre's popularity.
This is useful as it can offer developers or investors of video games insights as to what genre can potentially rise in the future.

# 3. Data Preparation and Cleaning
Variables that were not very useful and null columns were removed. To make analysis easier later on, we changed the value type of variables to floats and integers accordingly. As many games were classified under multiple genres, we created a column for each genre through one-hot encoding.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
Through the use of different graphs such as jointplot, bar graphs, pie charts, word clouds , heatmaps and line charts, there were a few main observations. 'Adventure' was the genre with the largest proportion of popular games. While the average ratings of most genres fluctuated between 3.0 to 4.0 over the years, 'Visual Novel' maintained its position as highest rating, while MOBA reflected an anomaly of a 2.0 rating.

'Interested', 'Playing', 'Review count' showed higher correlation, so we shall place more focus on these variables. To understand more about the words that appeared in the word cloud on Reviews, we will be utilising TF-IDF.
