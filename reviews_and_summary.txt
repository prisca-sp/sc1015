convinced this is a roguelike for people who do not like the genre The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me too clean or something idk wish I liked it but I do not incredible art a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic People tell me this game gets really really good at some point but ive beaten entire games in the amount of time I gave this game No sou muito de jogo indie admito que joguei poucos mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida facilmente no top 15 Toda sua arte dublagem gameplay carisma dos personagens  tudo incrivel I cant shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades Ive picked up Hades three times over the last few years and three times Ive found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours especially after reaching the third stage and I couldnt figure out why it wasnt working for me After giving it a few good goes Ive finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesnt click for me about Hades One of my favorites in the roguelikeslites only being beat by binding of Isaac I love the characters Thanatos my beloved and the writing and the art style and RRRAAAAHHH THIS GAME IS AWESOME	A roguelite hack and slash dungeon crawler in which Zagreus son of Hades the Greek god of the dead attempts to escape his home and his oppressive father by fighting the souls of the dead through the various layers of the evershifting underworld while getting to know and forging relationships with its inhabitants
soundtrack is tied for 1 with nier automata  a super charming story and characters which have become iconic and all that made by 1 man thats it thats the review i have no criticisms Just play this game Dont look at any of these reviews just pick the game up and know nothing else about it if you are one of the lucky ones that didnt get spoiled on the game It will fucking break you in the best of ways No h palavras que deem para descrever a experincia que foi esse jogo CLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC whooaa ohh ohhhh ohoohhohh ohhwooaah story of undertale A nice unique take on the RPG indie game format by incorporating really good ideas funny interactions an incredibly subtle story and wonderful music Definitely a must play if you have not already	A small child falls into the Underground where monsters have long been banished by humans and are hunting every human that they find The player controls the child as they try to make it back to the Surface through hostile environments all the while engaging with a turnbased combat system with puzzlesolving and bullet hell elements as well as other unconventional game mechanics
this games worldbuilding is incredible with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like youre spiderman  one of the best value in gaming tbh this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bossesboss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons cant wait to play silksong when i turn 8 This isnt just a game this is an entire experience                                          I was not too much into Metroidvania games and then I tried this without any expectation it became one of my favorite games of all time and brought me into the genre now Im seeking for similar adventures and I cant wait for Silksong                                          Ive done all 112 in my first run and now Im beating the game again then Ill aim to master the game on Steam and this is the first time a game instigated me to do that Masterpiece Faz uns 23 anos que eu zerei esse jogo mesmo assim nunca saiu da minha memria                                          Vou rejogar para fazer uma anlise mais aprofundada i like how you can bounce on spikes with your nail a good casual game that offers additional challenges for people that are socially challenged A rivetting actionadventure game with a stunning design Extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times Id give this game a 4 for each individual aspect platforming exploration combat but the integration and packaging of the content are so good its slightly better that the sum of its parts Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful and many evoke that Super Metroidy gleeful feeling that youll finally be able to access that new area grab that item or beat that boss The endgame challenges reminiscent of Wileys fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully selfactualized were the highlight Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master I found uses for some charms I had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics My only gripes                                          The repeated backtracking I get it  a fasttravel mechanic thats too liberal can erase the environment but this was excessive                                          Some of the charms seemed worthless even after strategizing for boss combat and platforming rushes                                          In the name of decency and civility make geosucking ability automatic	A 2D metroidvania with an emphasis on close combat and exploration in which the player enters the onceprosperous nowbleak insect kingdom of Hallownest travels through its various districts meets friendly inhabitants fights hostile ones and uncovers the kingdoms history while improving their combat abilities and movement arsenal by fighting bosses and accessing outoftheway areas
The best game Ive played in my life omori is a game held up by its heartbreaking emotional story and lifelike characters and ultimately let down by lackluster battle mechanics and a gimmicky otherworld I FUCKING LOVE AIR CONDITIONING didnt close my eyes Still not finished but loving the game One of my favorite games of all time it definitely has flaws with its pacing god I fucking hate sweethearts castle section but the twist and just overall the characters are so likeable and well written like Aubrey Kel and HeroI dont really care too much about Sunny but hes alright I guess gets the job done I feel basil could definitely use some more screentime the guy rarely gets any in the real world section of the game The writing is pretty good too though Im not a fan of the le quirky random indie game writing xdddd like this game has but there were times where it did make me chuckle	A turnbased surreal horror RPG in which a child traverses various mundane quirky humourous mysterious and horrific lands with his friends in search of a missing person while confronting his past and his fears Explore a strange world full of colorful friends and foes When the time comes the path youve chosen will determine your fate and perhaps the fate of others as well
Have only been a Metroid fan for couple of years but I think this was worth the 19 year wait The most unexpected Nintendo release of 221 a pretty good offering by Mercury Steam while some ideas are questionable like these invulnerable bosses that need to be avoided they do add up to the tension The final boss is unforgiving and punishes hard The best 2D metroid has been The art design in this one pops out so much youll remember distinct areas for later The abilities are so fast in this one and some puzzles require some strong thinking even knowing where the item locations are there was nothing dreadful about this game nothing context sensitive grappling hooks are a hatecrime This is by far the best 2D Metroid Not only is the game loop refined but the cinematics and story really surprised me Samus exudes badass every moment shes on screen  A must play Also the bosses are god damn brutal compared to previous Metroids	Join intergalactic bounty hunter Samus Aran in her first new 2D Metroid story in 19 years Samus story continues after the events of the Metroid Fusion game when she descends upon planet ZDR to investigate a mysterious transmission sent to the Galactic Federation The remote planet has become overrun by vicious alien lifeforms and chilling mechanical menaces Samus is more agile and capable than ever but can she overcome the inhuman threat stalking the depths of ZDR
its a solid party game im bad at lying though and it makes me feel bad not a complaint with the game its a complaint with myself that makes it harder for me personally to enjoy  amogus lie to your friends simulator Amogus I vote we just shoot Wawa into space and see what happens ya i beat among us what about it	Join your crewmates in a multiplayer game of teamwork and betrayal Play with 415 players online or via local WiFi as you attempt to prepare your spaceship for departure but beware as one or more random players among the Crew are Impostors bent on killing everyone
Holy shit im carrying the weight of the wooooooooooooooooooorld no me llamaba la atencin y lo compr por el precio y un cacho de curiosidad me volvi totalmente loco todo la historia el arte el mundo  y la BANDA SONORA SEXO  NieR Automata is an unforgettable game Androids vs Machines all while trying to save humanity and uncover the cold truth of this postapocalyptic world 2B and 9S share a common goal but have differing views through the story The combat is more fleshed out than its predecessor due to chips and pod mechanics Characters change and face reality after meeting characters and concepts never seen before This is my favorite game ever and the only game I cared enough about to get the platinum trophy in I might be biased here but the game has a lot of things I loved going in like the post apocalyptic setting The game isnt perfect and while things like the 9s hacking and route b pushed a lot of people away I still thoroughly enjoyed it Getting ending s and the final shut em up section in the credits ending with me giving up my save file to protect a fellow player is one of the most beautiful moments Ive seen in fiction as a whole	NieR Automata tells the story of androids 2B 9S and A2 and their battle to reclaim the machinedriven dystopia overrun by powerful machines
Verdadeiro goty 217 zelda  o caralho Vai tomar no cu Ryuji This game is great and to many people this is probably one of the greatest JRPGs if not overall game of all time I see that 1 but I personally have my nitpicks with it such as                                          The pacing of the game                                          The fact it only gets good 34 hours into the game                                          The fact that essential strategic and most importantly fun mechanics are locked behind confidants such as switching your party midbattle                                          The lack of freedom to do what you want                                          Similar to SMT IVIVA and maybe other SMTPersona games idk they sell DLC for super powerful personas In SMTIV at least these were entirely optional and you had to purchase them In Persona 5 Royal they included the DLC which again I could ignore if they are optional but I cant Unlike in pervious games there are legitimate fusions using legitimate personas that allow you to straightup just get these P2W personas naturally which I absolute fathom and throws the balance of the game out the window                                          And more importantly the entirety of Kasumis character prethird semester I want to punch her Vanilla was my first persona and smt game Kinda feels like coming home whenever i play it If you have a spare 1 hours lying around do this was pretty good 4 better tho i love goro akechi Played like 5 hrs I guess finished half or twothirds of it Cannot say I didnt like Persona 5 at all but this sort of infantile fleur around the characters and situations got me at last I played some SMT games and they seemed much more sophisticated and thoughtful especially the 4th However I cannot say that Persona 5 is a bad game although my experience with it was a bit rough I had this state of waiting for something like 51 hours more and something incredible would happen for sure characters pull off some weird moves and the real Persona the one everyone is so hyped up about would begin Never happened Might finish it sometime later tho whenever vibes come back	An enhanced version of Persona 5 with some new characters and a third semester added to the game Released Internationally in 22
