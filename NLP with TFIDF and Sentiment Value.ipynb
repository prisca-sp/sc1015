As long as the review contains english words, the sentiment analysis will still use those english words and evaluate whether the reviews are positive or negative. From some games (Eg. 1482, Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout), the sentiment values were below 0, indicating a negative review. Although these reviews contained spanish words, the sentiment values were still correct judging by the english sentences that were in these reviews."
