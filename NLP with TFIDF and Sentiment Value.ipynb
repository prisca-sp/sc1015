Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist. Wer die Filme liebt, kann hier eigentlich kaum etwas falsch machen. Spannend, toll geschrieben, mit viel Humor und dem Herz am rechten Fleck. Ein Muss für alle, die sich einen vierten Teil wünschen, aber Angst haben, dass ein weiterer Film das Ansehen der Reihe zerstören könnte.', \"Probably the closest we'll get to a good Back to the Future 4 and I'm fine with that.\"]   \n",

Astarion is funny as fuck, but is also just one dimensional. If you wanna be good then don't have him in your party because he will not like anything you do. Will is the only party member that I even remotely like. He is at least a nice guy with an okay backstory. Game is also terribly optimized for storage.\"]   \n",

       "2  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.   \n",

E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.']   \n",

Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.   \n",

       "2  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.   \n",

Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses.

While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method.

While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method.

E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo. Acho que o unico defeito é esses sistema chatinho de durabilidade das armas, ficar trocando de arma o tempo todo é tão chato, espero que no próximo não tenha.']   \n",

    "The sentiment values are still valid. As long as the review contains english words, the sentiment analysis will still use those english words and evaluate whether the reviews are positive or negative. From some games (Eg. 1482, Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout), the sentiment values were below 0, indicating a negative review. Although these reviews contained spanish words, the sentiment values still correleated to the original feels to the game, as there were negative english reveiews in these reviews. Hence, not much of a different can be seen from before and after."

       "3  this games worldbuilding is incredible with its amazing soundtrack and gorgeous art direction it really makes you feel like youre spiderman  one of the best value in gaming tbh this game is packed full of content and none of it feels like filler even the boss rush manages to feel fresh by introducing some surprise bossesboss variants as rewards for beating tough pantheons cant wait to play silksong when i turn 8 This isnt just a game this is an entire experience                                          I was not too much into Metroidvania games and then I tried this without any expectation it became one of my favorite games of all time and brought me into the genre now Im seeking for similar adventures and I cant wait for Silksong                                          Ive done all 112 in my first run and now Im beating the game again then Ill aim to master the game on Steam and this is the first time a game instigated me to do that Masterpiece Faz uns 23 anos que eu zerei esse jogo mesmo assim nunca saiu da minha memria                                          Vou rejogar para fazer uma anlise mais aprofundada i like how you can bounce on spikes with your nail a good casual game that offers additional challenges for people that are socially challenged A rivetting actionadventure game with a stunning design Extremely rewarding but also gruesomly difficult at times Id give this game a 4 for each individual aspect platforming exploration combat but the integration and packaging of the content are so good its slightly better that the sum of its parts Most of the combat and traversal abilities feel useful and many evoke that Super Metroidy gleeful feeling that youll finally be able to access that new area grab that item or beat that boss The endgame challenges reminiscent of Wileys fortress and boss rushes after Megaman has fully selfactualized were the highlight Boss rushes in particular were fun to dissect and master I found uses for some charms I had written off as not my style to counter some of the unconventional boss mechanics My only gripes                                          The repeated backtracking I get it  a fasttravel mechanic thats too liberal can erase the environment but this was excessive                                          Some of the charms seemed worthless even after strategizing for boss combat and platforming rushes                                          In the name of decency and civility make geosucking ability automatic   \n",
